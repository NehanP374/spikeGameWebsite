     <p style="color: black; font-family: sans-serif">Firstly I added a code where I can spawn random spikes inside of the game between 0.2 to 0.9 seconds. And I also added an action to make the spikes go below the layer and not overlap the layer. Then I copied and pasted both of the actions 2 more times so the spike spawn will increase. <br> 



Then I gave the player a life. I added a global variable of “isAlive= 1” and then added it to the start of the layout. And then added an event of isalive= 0 when the layer touches the spike And added actions like destroying the spike, destroy the player, The score with stop and PLay again and the home sprite will pop up <br> 


Then I made a homeLayout With two buttons Play and More games then I added On touch and then added an event of On touching play button go to the gameLayout and on touching more games button go to the construct three. <br>


Then I also added on touch in the game layout and events like on touching play again restart the game and on touching home go to the home layout. <br>

Then I also added an action where the background color of the home and game layout will change every time we restart the game. <br>


And with the help of photoshop, I finally gave the spike and ball a realistic 2D shape.
